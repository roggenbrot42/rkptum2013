\chapter{Conclusion}
Our rootkit provides basic functionality, which enables the user to control and monitor some aspects of the destination system. As we implemented the rootkit step by step and module after module, one still could integrate all parts into one module, which should be possible without problems, as we tried to design each module to be extendable and flexible.\\
However there are still some improvement possibilities, like the overall stability of some modules like Package Hiding, which crash on high traffic frequency as already described.\\
All in all we have learned a lot about the Linux kernel internals and had a lot of fun while implementing the rootkit.
