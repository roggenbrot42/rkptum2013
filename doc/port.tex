\section{Port knocking prevention}
The idea behind the implemented port knocking prevention is to simulate a 
situation in which the hidden port is not opened by a listening service.
Every IPv4 TCP packet is handled by the \textit{tcp_v4_rcv()} function. This 
function uses the \textit{__inet_lookup_skb()} function to resolve the socket 
corresponding to the port number in the packet header. 
To do so, the kernel module hijacks the \textit{__inet_lookup_listener} 
%%TODO: explain how
function that obtains the listening socket for a given port number.
