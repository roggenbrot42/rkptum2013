Source code for a Linux kernel root kit we wrote for a practical course back in university.

The code was written for Linux 3.15. I put it up here because the course no longer exists and I'd like to share my results for interested students.
There are some explanations in doc/ and in the src/README* files. 

Use this code only within the legal bounds of your country. I am not responsible for anything you do with this, use at your own risk.
