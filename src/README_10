Description
    - Hide tcp/udp packets which are sniffed using libpcap
    - Pass source or destination IP address of packets to be hidden as a command line 
      argument to the module 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation

Installation instructions
    - Compile the module
      # make
    - Insert the module
      IP address of packets to be hidden can be spcified, using following command
      line arguments. Default ip is "127.0.0.1"
      # insmod rootkit.ko [ip=10.0.2.2]
    - Remove the module
      # rmmod rootkit

Technical note
    - Libcap sniffs network traffic through a PF_PACKET socket and receive clones 
      of packets. To hide packets, sniffed by libcap, one needs to hook the 
      function for receiving packets of packet sockets, used by libcap. The 
      functions that deal with the packets are implemented in 
      net/packet.af_packet.c: 
        int tpacket_rcv(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *dev, struct packet_type *, struct net_device *); 
    - There are two ways to hook the function tpacket_rcv:
      - Change the operation pointer (point to the function tpacket_rcv) of the 
        struct packet_sock by hooking the syscall funktion:
        long sys_socket(int, int, int);
        (Not easy to reverse the pointer when unloading, especially to deal with 
        more than one packet socket.)
      - Inject assembler code to the origin tpacket_rcv function. One can use
        the assembler code:
          pushq imm32;
          retq;
        to cause the instruction pointer to jump to a hooking function.
        (Leads to exception, caused by too frequent traffic, because the original
        function is continously changed to the modified code version and reversed 
        to hide the packets of given IP address and report other packets at the
        same time)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Details
    - void hide_packets(void): 
      - Read the address of the function packet_rcv using the kernel function 
        kallsys_lookup_name("tpacket_rcv"). 
      - Store the original 6 byte code of the function packet_rcv and replace it
        with the assembler code.
    - void unhide_packets(void): reverse the code injection.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Notes
	  Please load the module, when tcpdump runs locally or via ssh with filter to not 
    sniff this ssh traffic. 
    Loading the module leads to exception, when tcpdump is runned via ssh without 
    filtering, because running tcpdump by ssh leads to loops and hence destroys 
    the hiding mechanism (See Technical note above).
