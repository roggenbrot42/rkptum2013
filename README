Description
    - File hiding, process hiding, module hiding, and socket hiding controlled by 
      self-defined commands
    - Escalates the current privileges to root by manipulating the current shell

Installation instructions
    - Compile the module
      # make
    - Insert the module
      # insmod rootkit.ko 
    - Remove the module
      # rmmod rootkit    
    - Hide module
      # hideme
    - Show module
      # unhideme
    - Hide processes
      # hidepid pid1,pid2,...
    - Hide files with the prefix "rootkit_"
      # hidefile
    - Show hidden files
      # unhidef
    - Hide tcp sockets
      # socktcp port1,port2,...
    - Hide udp sockets
      # sockudp port1,port2,...
    - TODO Show hidden sockets
    - Privilege Escalation

Technical note
  - Every process in linux has two sets of credentials, task -> real_cred points
    real subjective task credentials and task -> cred points effective subjective 
    task credentials. Both are const, not modifyable. The following 4 functions are 
    provided to modify the credentials of a process:
      - struct cred *prepare_creds(void); 
        Create a new set of credentials, which is a copy of the current credentials 
        but modifyable.
      - const struct cred *override_creds(const struct cred *);
        Override the current process's subjective credentials (task -> cred) temporarily
      - void revert_creds(const struct cred *);
        Revert a temporary subjective credentials override
      - int commit_creds(struct cred *); 
        Install a new set of credentials to the current process
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Details
  - Privilege Escalation
    - prepare_creds() creates a new set of credentials, which is modifyable.
    - change real uid, real gid, effective uid, effective gid, uid for VFS operations
      and gid for VFS operations to root id
    - commit_creds() installs new credentials upon the current task
  - Command reading: See the README of the last assignment
  - Command parsing:
    All input with max. 8 characters is copied into a 64bit integer variable. This is to
    improve the performance when finding the the command in the command list and also the
    reason why commands mustn't be longer than 8 chars. All commands are stored in a
    'command' struct, that contains its name, length of the name, the 'hashcode' (the 64bit 
    number), an indicator for the type of argument, a void pointer to the function that 
    shall be invoked and the list structure. It would have been more elegant to store the 
    name and the 'hashcode' in a union, but that would still require a way to convert the 
    input.
    Currently, 3 types of arguments are supported: NOARG (no arguments), INTARG (single int),
    INTLST (comma separated list of ints). The format is: command argument(, argument2)*

Additional Notes
	To unload the module, all other terminal sessions have to disconnect or write to stdin.
